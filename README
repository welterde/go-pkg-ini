This package parser INI-style configuration files common on *nix systems.
Supported are single key/value pairs as well as keys with list values. Lists of
items are defined as space-separated elements encapsulated by ( and )

example:

	DAEMONS=(network crond hal vboxdrv)

Because a list can contain many items, this construct is the only one that may
be defined across multiple lines in the ini file. The rest are all limited to a
single line.

Comments in the inifile are supported by prefixing a comment with #. At this
point, comment information is entirely disgarded when an ini file is loaded. So
when saving the loaded file out again, this information is lost permanently!

TODO: Implement Marshal/Unmarshal functions.

This is version 0.1. And as everyone knows, the first version of anything is
always crap. Plenty of room for optimization and improvement so use at your own
risk.
